However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed-to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can... but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will's thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown.

Lily travels from London, England to the Amazon jungle and enlists Frank’s questionable services to guide her downriver on La Quila—his ramshackle-but-charming boat. Lily is determined to uncover an ancient tree with unparalleled healing abilities—possessing the power to change the future of medicine. Thrust on this epic quest together, the unlikely duo encounters innumerable dangers and supernatural forces, all lurking in the deceptive beauty of the lush rainforest. But as the secrets of the lost tree unfold, the stakes reach even higher for Lily and Frank and their fate—and mankind’s—hangs in the balance.",

            "longDescription": "Acclaimed director George Stevens’ legendary rendition of the quintessential Western myth earned six Academy Award® nominations, and made Shane one of the classics of the American cinema. The story brings Alan Ladd, a drifter and retired gunfighter, to the assistance of a homestead family terrorized by a wealthy cattleman and his hired gun (Jack Palance). In fighting the last decisive battle, Shane sees the end of his own way of life. Mysterious, moody and atmospheric, the film is enhanced by the intense performances of its splendid cast."

When beautiful perfume sales girl, Lola Bunny receives the flower as a gift (unaware of it's awesome power), she adds the magical ingredient to her latest perfume creation. With hopes that she has crafted the next big scent, Lola hails crazed cabbies Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck for a hasty trip to Paris! In hot pursuit is a host of rabid Looney Tunes all-stars, all seeking the sweet-smelling invisibility spray! Foghorn Leghorn, Elmer Fudd, and Yosemite Sam are but a few fan favorites, stretching out in all-new roles. Marvin the Martian may have the most devious plan for the potion; to erase the planet earth – oh, dear! So spring into this high-speed, globe-trotting, globe-threatening frenzy and see who wins out in this fun-packed Looney Tunes romp!"

            "description": "In Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 Personal Finance book of all time, Robert Kiyosaki shares the story of his two dad: his real father, whom he calls his ‘poor dad,’ and the father of his best friend, the man who became his mentor and his ‘rich dad.’ One man was well educated and an employee all his life, the other’s education was “street smarts” over traditional classroom education and he took the path of entrepreneurship…a road that led him to become one of the wealthiest men in Hawaii. Robert’s poor dad struggled financially all his life, and these two dads—these very different points of view of money, investing, and employment—shaped Robert’s thinking about money.<br /><br />Robert has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of people, around the world, think about money and investing and he has become a global advocate for financial education and the path to financial freedom. Rich Dad Poor Dad (and the Rich Dad series it spawned) has sold over 36 million copies in English and translated editions around the world.<br /><br />Rich Dad Poor Dad will…<br />• explode the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich<br />• challenge the belief that your house is an asset<br />• show parents why they can’t rely on the school system to teach their kids<br />\tabout money<br />• define, once and for all, an asset and a liability<br />• explain the difference between good debt and bad debt<br />• teach you to see the world of money from different perspectives<br />• discuss the shift in mindset that can put you on the road to financial freedom",

            "description": "This eBook is a summary of the bestselling book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ by Robert Kiyosaki.<br />\nRich Dad Poor Dad has been named the number one personal finance book of all time. Author Robert Kiyosaki writes about two dads, one his real father and the other his childhood friend’s father, the rich dad. The book discusses the ways in which both dads shaped Robert’s beliefs regarding money and investing. Rich Dad Poor Dad exposes the myth that to be rich you need to earn a high income. It also explores the difference between working for money and having money work for you.<br />\n<b>A Book Summary</b><br />\n‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ is a big book at over 280 pages, depending on the edition you read. If you are low on time, reading over 280 pages may simply be out of the question, that is where this eBook comes in! This eBook presents just the most important and impactful ideas discussed in ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, but removes the non-essential content. You are left with a summary that will provide all of the core benefits of reading the full 280 page book but without the time commitment.&#xa0;<br />\n<b>Book Synopsis</b><br />\n‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ is a story of two dads with very different opinions of money. One is a highly educated professor; the other dad is an eighth grade dropout. The highly educated dad passed away leaving his family with nothing except some unpaid bills. The eighth grade dropout dad became one of the richest men in Hawaii and left a business empire to his son. The educated dad would say “I can’t afford this”. The dropout dad would ask himself “How can I afford this?”.<br />\nRobert writes how the rich dad teaches two boys invaluable lessons about money by making them experience the lessons for themselves. The key concept of this book is to realize how to use your mindset and your time to create your personal wealth, free yourself from the “rat race”, open your eyes to the opportunities around you, create solutions and ultimately “mind your own business”. This book will teach you how to make money work for you and how not to become a slave to it.<br />\n<b>The Author</b><br />\nAuthor Robert Kiyosaki retired at the age of 47 but continued to explore his love of investing. During his retirement he wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad which went on to be a #1 New York Times bestseller. Following the success of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert followed up with more books including Cash flow Quadrant, Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing and Rich Kid Smart Kid.",

Packed with straight talk, sidebars, and quizzes, this book will jumpstart a child’s personal and financial success by teaching: How to speak the language of money, ways to make money work for you, tips for success (including: “Work to learn, not to earn.”), and <br />why games can help you understand money, investing, and ways to choose your best path to financial freedom.",

            "description": "<b>RIch Dad Poor Dad - A Book Summary - What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!</b><br />\r\n<b></b><br />\r\nKey take-away from this book: Being rich is a mindset, not a sum of money. The rich don’t think the way that most of us who are trapped in the Rat Race do. The rich buy and build assets that put money back in their pocket. Once their assets are generating enough money to live off, a completely new world of freedom opens up where they can work for themselves rather than working for someone else.<br />\r\nThe son of one of the authors summed it up well in the book introduction. “Mom, I don’t want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I’ll wind up like you, working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today earn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don’t make nearly as much money as they used to. I know I can’t rely on Social Security or company pensions for retirement. I need new answers.”<br />\r\nThe old answer is the Rat Race, “where you work for the owners of a company, for the government paying taxes, and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. We advise our children to ‘study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or career’ but this is risky advice. “That is old advice, and it’s bad advice. If you could see what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.”<br />\r\nHere is a Preview of what you will get:<br />\r\nA Full Book Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nFun quizzes\r\n\r\n\r\nQuiz Answers\r\n\r\n\r\nEtc\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGet a copy of this summary and learn about the ebook.&#xa0;",

Все это приводит к тому, что мы вынуждены всю жизнь работать за деньги и зарабатывать их для других. И это вместо того, чтобы заставить работать деньги на себя!<br /><br />В центре книги – история самого Кийосаки. Его воспитывали два папы. Один - бедный - государственный служащий, второй - богатый - бизнесмен, ставший одним из самых влиятельных людей на Гавайских островах.<br /><br />Маленький Роберт выбрал путь, предложенный Богатым папой, и добился того, что стал финансово обеспеченным человеком. И теперь он готов делиться секретами своего успеха. А они работают, ведь неслучайно его бестселлер считают обязательным чтением для миллионеров!",

            "description": "A Comprehensive Study Guide of Rich Dad, Poor Dad\n\nKey take-away from this book: Being rich is a mindset, not a sum of money. The rich don’t think the way that most of us who are trapped in the Rat Race do. The rich buy and build assets that put money back in their pocket. Once their assets are generating enough money to live off, a completely new world of freedom opens up where they can work for themselves rather than working for someone else.\nThe son of one of the authors summed it up well in the book introduction. “Mom, I don’t want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I’ll wind up like you, working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today earn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don’t make nearly as much money as they used to. I know I can’t rely on Social Security or company pensions for retirement. I need new answers.”\nThe old answer is the Rat Race, “where you work for the owners of a company, for the government paying taxes, and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. We advise our children to ‘study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or career’ but this is risky advice. “That is old advice, and it’s bad advice. If you could see what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.”\n\n\nHere is a Preview of What You Will Get:\n\n\n⁃\tA Detailed Introduction \n⁃\tA Comprehensive Chapter by Chapter Study Guide\n⁃\tEtc\n\nGet a copy of this study guide and learn about the book.",

            "description": "In Rich Dad Poor Dad, l'imprenditore americano Robert Kiyosaki sottolinea che la ricchezza si basa su alcuni principi fondamentali che spesso vengono trascurati a favore di una buona istruzione e del duro lavoro, il che significa che la maggior parte delle persone non riuscirà mai a sfuggire alla corsa del topo. Questo riassunto e analisi, chiaro e dettagliato, è una risorsa preziosa per chiunque voglia comprendere il rivoluzionario libro di Kiyosaki: presenta una spiegazione approfondita della sua filosofia imprenditoriale, dei concetti principali alla base del suo lavoro, come il suo punto di vista sul flusso di cassa e la sua insistenza sull'azione, e del contesto in cui si inserisce il suo lavoro, compreso l'arrivo del nuovo millennio. Fornisce inoltre un'introduzione ai concetti chiave suggeriti dall'autore per liberarsi dalla corsa del topo, alle principali critiche mosse al suo lavoro e alle potenziali estensioni del suo approccio, offrendo tutto ciò che serve per comprendere questo libro di valore inestimabile in soli 50 minuti.&#xa0;<br /><br />A proposito di Rich Dad Poor Dad : Rich Dad Poor Dad nasce dal desiderio di Kiyosaki di fare soldi e dall'interazione con le due principali figure paterne della sua vita: il padre biologico, o povero, e il padre-figura, o ricco. Sebbene l'autore sia stato inizialmente costretto ad autopubblicare Rich Dad Poor Dad, il libro è diventato un successo clamoroso, vendendo oltre 26 milioni di copie e ricevendo l'appoggio di una serie di celebrità, tra cui il magnate dei media Oprah Winfrey e il presidente Donald Trump. Informazioni su Robert Kiyosaki : Robert Kiyosaki è nato alle Hawaii nel 1947 da genitori nippo-americani. Fin da giovane si rese conto delle disuguaglianze di ricchezza, guardando con invidia molti dei suoi compagni di classe che avevano un tenore di vita di gran lunga superiore al suo. Lui e il suo amico Mike decisero che non avrebbero lasciato che le loro umili origini li frenassero nella vita, decidendo di avere il massimo successo possibile. Mike alla fine rilevò l'attività del padre, mentre Robert divenne multimilionario e un rispettato uomo d'affari.",

            "description": "Στο βιβλίο Rich Dad Poor Dad, ο Αμερικανός επιχειρηματίας Robert Kiyosaki τονίζει ότι ο πλούτος βασίζεται σε μερικές βασικές αρχές που συχνά παραβλέπονται προς όφελος της καλής εκπαίδευσης και της σκληρής δουλειάς, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι η πλειοψηφία των ανθρώπων δεν θα ξεφύγει ποτέ από την κούρσα των αρουραίων. Αυτή η σαφής και λεπτομερής περίληψη και ανάλυση αποτελεί πολύτιμο βοήθημα για όποιον θέλει να κατανοήσει το επαναστατικό βιβλίο του Kiyosaki: περιλαμβάνει μια διεξοδική εξήγηση της επιχειρηματικής φιλοσοφίας του, τις κύριες έννοιες στις οποίες στηρίζεται το έργο του, όπως η άποψή του για την ταμειακή ροή και η επιμονή του στην ανάληψη δράσης, καθώς και το πλαίσιο του έργου του, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του ερχομού της νέας χιλιετίας. Παρέχει επίσης μια εισαγωγή στις βασικές έννοιες που προτείνει για να απελευθερωθείτε από την κούρσα των αρουραίων, τις κύριες επικρίσεις του έργου του και τις πιθανές επεκτάσεις της προσέγγισής του, δίνοντάς σας όλα όσα χρειάζεστε για να κατανοήσετε αυτό το ανεκτίμητο βιβλίο σε μόλις 50 λεπτά. Σχετικά με το Rich Dad Poor Dad : Το Rich Dad Poor Dad προήλθε από την επιθυμία του Kiyosaki να βγάλει χρήματα και την αλληλεπίδρασή του με τις δύο κύριες πατρικές φιγούρες στη ζωή του: τον βιολογικό, ή φτωχό, πατέρα του και τον πατροπαράδοτο, ή πλούσιο, πατέρα του. Παρόλο που ο συγγραφέας αναγκάστηκε αρχικά να εκδώσει μόνος του το Rich Dad Poor Dad, το βιβλίο γνώρισε τεράστια επιτυχία, πουλώντας πάνω από 26 εκατομμύρια αντίτυπα και υποστηριζόμενο από μια σειρά διασημοτήτων, όπως η μεγιστάνας των μέσων ενημέρωσης Oprah Winfrey και ο πρόεδρος Donald Trump.<br /><br />Σχετικά με τον Robert Kiyosaki : Ο Robert Kiyosaki γεννήθηκε στη Χαβάη το 1947 από ιαπωνοαμερικανούς γονείς. Από νεαρή ηλικία συνειδητοποίησε τις ανισότητες στον πλούτο, καθώς έβλεπε με φθόνο πολλούς συμμαθητές του που είχαν σαφώς ένα βιοτικό επίπεδο πολύ ανώτερο από το δικό του. Αυτός και ο φίλος του Mike αποφάσισαν ότι δεν θα άφηναν την ταπεινή τους καταγωγή να τους κρατήσει πίσω στη ζωή, αποφασίζοντας να γίνουν όσο το δυνατόν πιο επιτυχημένοι. Ο Μάικ ανέλαβε τελικά την επιχείρηση του πατέρα του, ενώ ο Ρόμπερτ έγινε πολυεκατομμυριούχος και αξιοσέβαστος επιχειρηματίας",

            "description": "In Rich Dad Poor Dad, the American businessman Robert Kiyosaki highlights that wealth is based on a few basic principles that are often overlooked in favor of good education and hard work, meaning that the majority of people will never escape the rat race. This clear and detailed summary and analysis is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to understand Kiyosaki’s revolutionary book: it features a thorough explanation of his business philosophy, the main concepts underpinning his work, such as his view on cash flow and his insistence on taking action, and the contextual background to his work, including the coming of the new millenium. It also provides an introduction to the key concepts he suggests to break free from the rat race, the main criticisms of his work and potential extensions of his approach, giving you everything you need to understand this invaluable book in just 50 minutes.<br /><br />About Rich Dad Poor Dad : Rich Dad Poor Dad stemmed from Kiyosaki’s desire to make money and his interaction with the two main father figures in his life: his biological, or poor, father and his father-figure, or rich, father. Although the author was originally forced to self-publish Rich Dad Poor Dad, the book became a resounding success, selling over 26 million copies and endorsed by a string of celebrities, including media mogul Oprah Winfrey and President Donald Trump. About Robert Kiyosaki : Robert Kiyosaki was born in Hawaii in 1947 to Japanese-American parents. He became aware of wealth inequalities from a young age, looking on with envy at many of his classmates who clearly had a standard of living far superior to his own. He and his friend Mike decided that they would not let their humble beginnings hold them back in life, resolving to be as successful as possible. Mike eventually took over his father’s business, while Robert became a multimillionaire and a respected businessman.",

            "description": "W Rich Dad Poor Dad amerykański biznesmen Robert Kiyosaki podkreśla, że bogactwo opiera się na kilku podstawowych zasadach, które są często pomijane na rzecz dobrego wykształcenia i ciężkiej pracy, co oznacza, że większość ludzi nigdy nie ucieknie od wyścigu szczurów. To jasne i szczegółowe streszczenie i analiza jest cennym źródłem informacji dla każdego, kto chce zrozumieć rewolucyjną książkę Kiyosakiego: zawiera dokładne wyjaśnienie jego filozofii biznesowej, głównych koncepcji leżących u podstaw jego pracy, takich jak jego pogląd na przepływy pieniężne i nacisk na podejmowanie działań, a także kontekstowe tło jego pracy, w tym nadejście nowego tysiąclecia. Zawiera również wprowadzenie do kluczowych koncepcji, które proponuje, aby uwolnić się od wyścigu szczurów, główne krytyki jego pracy i potencjalne rozszerzenia jego podejścia, dając ci wszystko, czego potrzebujesz, aby zrozumieć tę bezcenną książkę w zaledwie 50 minut.&#xa0;<br /><br />O Rich Dad Poor Dad : Rich Dad Poor Dad wywodzi się z pragnienia Kiyosakiego, aby zarabiać pieniądze i jego interakcji z dwoma głównymi postaciami ojców w jego życiu: jego biologicznym, lub biednym, ojcem i jego ojcem-figurą, lub bogatym, ojcem. Chociaż autor był początkowo zmuszony do samodzielnej publikacji Rich Dad Poor Dad, książka stała się spektakularnym sukcesem, sprzedając się w ponad 26 milionach egzemplarzy i wspierana przez szereg gwiazd, w tym magnata medialnego Oprah Winfrey i prezydenta Donalda Trumpa.&#xa0;<br /><br />O Robercie Kiyosaki : Robert Kiyosaki urodził się na Hawajach w 1947 roku z japońsko-amerykańskich rodziców. Stał się świadomy nierówności majątkowych od najmłodszych lat, patrząc z zazdrością na wielu swoich kolegów z klasy, którzy wyraźnie mieli standard życia znacznie wyższy od jego własnego. On i jego przyjaciel Mike postanowili, że nie pozwolą, aby ich skromne początki powstrzymały ich w życiu, postanawiając odnieść jak największy sukces. Mike w końcu przejął firmę ojca, a Robert stał się multimilionerem i szanowanym biznesmenem.",

You just need to be willing to break the rules.</b><br /><br />At nineteen, I founded a software company with $119 in my bank account. Five years later, it was valued at $10.5 million. I don't consider myself exceptionally brilliant. I just realized something few people know: You don't need lots of money or an original idea to get really rich. <br /><br />Now, I make more than $100,000 in passive income every month, while also running my own private equity firm and hosting <i>The Top Entrepreneurs</i> podcast, which has more than 10 million downloads. This book will show you how I went from college dropout to member of the New Rich. And I'm holding nothing back. You'll see my tax returns, my profit and loss statements, my email negotiations when buying and selling companies. <br /><br />It's time to forget your grandfather's advice. I'll teach you how to be a modern opportunist--investor, entrepreneur, or side hustler--by breaking these four golden rules of the old guard:<br /><br />1.Focus on one skill: Wrong. Don't cultivate one great skill to get ahead. In today's business world, success goes to the multitaskers.<br />2.Be unique: Wrong. The way to get rich is not by launching a new idea but by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist. <br />3.Focus on one goal: Wrong. Focus instead on creating a system to produce the outcome you want, not just once, but over and over again. <br />4.Appeal to the masses: Wrong. The masses are broke ($4k average net worth in America?). Let others cut a trail through the jungle so you can peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work.<br /><br />By rejecting these defunct rules and following my unconventional path, you can copy other people's ideas shamelessly, bootstrap a start-up with almost no funding, invest in small local businesses for huge payoffs, and reap all the benefits.",

            "description": "<b>Do teachers have a front row seat to America’s decline?</b><br /><br />Jeremy S. Adams, a teacher at both the high school and college levels, thinks so.<br /><br />Adams has spent decades trying to instill wisdom, ambition, and a love of learning in his students. And yet, as he notes, when teachers get together, they often share an arresting conclusion: Something has gone terribly wrong. Something essential is missing in our young people.<br /><br />Their curiosity seems stunted, their reason undeveloped, their values uninformed, their knowledge lacking, and most worrying of all, their humanity diminished.<br /><br />Digital hermits of a sort unfamiliar to an older generation, they have little interest in marriage and family. They largely dismiss—and are shockingly ignorant of—religion. They sneer at patriotism, sympathize with riots and vandalism, and regard American society and civilization as so radically flawed that it must be dismantled. Often friendless and depressed, they eat alone, study alone, and even “socialize” alone.<br /><br />Educators like Adams see a generation slipping away. The problems that have hollowed out&#xa0;our young people have been festering for years. A year of COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing have magnified them. The result could be a generation—and our nation’s future—lost in a miasma of alienation and stupefaction.<br /><br />In his stunning new book,&#xa0;<i>Hollowed Out</i>, Jeremy S. Adams reveals why students have rejected the wisdom, culture, and institutions of Western civilization—and what we can do to win them back. Poignant, frightening, and yet inspiring, this is a book for every parent, teacher, and patriot concerned for our young people and our country",

Machiavelli's tough-minded, pragmatic argument that sometimes it is necessary to abandon ethics to succeed made his name notorious. Yet his book has been read by strategists, politicians and business people ever since as the ultimate guide to realpolitik. <br /><br />How can a leader be strong and decisive, yet still inspire loyalty in his followers? How do you keep your enemies in check? Is it better to be feared than loved? When is it necessary to break the rules? This shrewd handbook on how power really works answers all these questions by examining regimes and their rulers around the world and throughout history, from Roman emperors to renaissance Popes, from the savagely cruel Hannibal to the utterly devious Cesare di Borgia. <br /><br />Tim Parks's gripping contemporary translation delivers Machiavelli's no-nonsense original straight, making it as alarming and enlightening as when it was first written.",

            "description": "Positive Parenting is a parenting book with a difference. It does not tell you the practicalities of raising a child such as how to potty train, or when to introduce solids foods. Instead, it argues that what really matters is helping children to grow up feeling secure and good about themselves. Children -like adults- perform best when they feel good about themselves. This book will show you how to help your child develop: * positive self-esteem * self-confidence * self reliance Positive self-esteem is the best gift any parent can give their child.

            "description": "A Comprehensive Book Review of Rich Dad, Poor Dad\r\n\r\nKey take-away from this book: Being rich is a mindset, not a sum of money. The rich don’t think the way that most of us who are trapped in the Rat Race do. The rich buy and build assets that put money back in their pocket. Once their assets are generating enough money to live off, a completely new world of freedom opens up where they can work for themselves rather than working for someone else.\r\nThe son of one of the authors summed it up well in the book introduction. “Mom, I don’t want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I’ll wind up like you, working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today earn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don’t make nearly as much money as they used to. I know I can’t rely on Social Security or company pensions for retirement. I need new answers.”\r\nThe old answer is the Rat Race, “where you work for the owners of a company, for the government paying taxes, and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. We advise our children to ‘study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or career’ but this is risky advice. “That is old advice, and it’s bad advice. If you could see what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.”\r\n\r\nHere is a Preview of What You Will Get:\r\n\r\n\r\n⁃\tA Detailed Introduction \r\n⁃\tA Comprehensive Chapter by Chapter Book Review\r\n⁃\tEtc\r\n\r\nGet a copy of this book review and learn about the book.",

In this book, Robert Kiyosaki shares his own personal story of growing up with two very different fathers - one rich and one poor - and the valuable lessons he learned from both of them.<br /><br />Through engaging anecdotes and simple, easy-to-understand language, Kiyosaki lays out the fundamental principles of wealth-building, including the importance of financial literacy, the difference between assets and liabilities, and the power of investing in assets that generate passive income.<br /><br />But \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" is more than just a practical guide to building wealth. It's a mindset shift that encourages readers to think outside the box and challenge the conventional wisdom about money and success. Kiyosaki argues that true wealth is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the quality of life that money can provide.<br /><br />Whether you're just starting out on your financial journey or you're a seasoned investor looking for fresh insights and inspiration, \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" is a must-read book that will challenge your assumptions and empower you to take control of your financial future.<br /><br /><b>Click on the \"BUY NOW\" to get your book Now!</b><br /><br /><i><b>Disclaimer: </b>This concise summary is unofficial and is not authorized, approved, licensed, or endorsed by the original book's publisher or author.

Is it just numbers? Sales volume? How do you get to the top of the market in boom times? How do you survive a soft market? What tools must you bring to the job? Is it at all like those reality shows on TV?<br /><br />Starting in his own backyard, <i>Esquire</i> writer Tom Chiarella explores the requisite skills needed to thrive in various real estate scenarios: a static buyer’s market in rural Indiana, a booming seller’s market in Seattle, and the incredibly high-end market of Chicago’s luxury high-rises. Forming a personal connection with each of his subjects, he watches them work in the front seat of their cars, at lunches, on street corners, and in the doorways of homes.<br /><br />What Chiarella discovers is that great real estate agents devote themselves to the job with a sense of craftsmanship. Showcasing the individual tools used to develop a successful real estate career, <i>Becoming a Real Estate Agent</i> profiles individuals who live a life of thrilling improvisation, action, and instinct—a life in which excellence is sometimes gauged by the ability to walk away from a commission when circumstance demands it.",

In fact, he claims, it is almost impossible to draw these distinctions.<br /><br />Using a variety of examples - from social bonds to securitisations risks - he highlights the weaknesses in innovative strategies, revealing how some innovation is doomed to failure.<br /><br />The consequences of innovation are now so crucial and so scrutinised - it is essential reading for anyone in the business world.<br /><br />Sections include:<br />Playing with fire<br />The ferment of finance<br />The little guy<br />From vanilla to rocky road<br />The fast and furious<br />Of plumbing and promises<br />On the side of the angels<br />Safety first",

It allows you to have the essential ideas of a big book in less than 30 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading this summary, you will learn that to become rich, you must give up your salary.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will also learn :<br/>\nthat being rich doesn&#39;t mean having a full bank account;<br/>\nwhat are the basics of a good financial education;<br/>\nhow to make money by working less;<br/>\nwhat rich parents teach their children from a young age.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarning money cannot be learned in school. It is usually a mindset passed on by parents who instill, voluntarily or involuntarily, their own view of money in their children, often as it has been passed on to them. Wealth is usually thought of in terms of inheritance, whereas a family&#39;s real wealth is the financial education it passes on. It is this legacy that allows one to free oneself, from an early age, from any feeling of dependence on money. As a child, Robert T. Kiyosaki grew up with two fathers whose financial realities were opposite: a poor father, his biological father, and a rich father, a family friend and mentor. While both men are hard-working, intelligent and well-paid, one will die in debt while the other bequeaths immense capital. What distinguishes these two destinies is simply the mastery of a financial education accessible to all, as the author who learned it at the age of 9 proves. Are you ready to change your vision of money and thus make the choice of wealth?<br/>\n<br/>\n*Buy now the summary of this book for the modest price of a cup of coffee!",

During his centuries of slumber, however, investments are made that make him the richest and most powerful man on Earth. But when he comes out of his trance he is horrified to discover that the money accumulated in his name is being used to maintain a hierarchal society in which most are poor, and more than a third of all people are enslaved. Oppressed and uneducated, the masses cling desperately to one dream - that the sleeper will awake, and lead them all to freedom.",

            "description": "Rich Dad, Poor Dad Summary - What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money - That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!\r\n\r\nKey take-away from this book: Being rich is a mindset, not a sum of money. The rich don’t think the way that most of us who are trapped in the Rat Race do. The rich buy and build assets that put money back in their pocket. Once their assets are generating enough money to live off, a completely new world of freedom opens up where they can work for themselves rather than working for someone else.\r\nThe son of one of the authors summed it up well in the book introduction. “Mom, I don’t want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I’ll wind up like you, working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today earn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don’t make nearly as much money as they used to. I know I can’t rely on Social Security or company pensions for retirement. I need new answers.”\r\nThe old answer is the Rat Race, “where you work for the owners of a company, for the government paying taxes, and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. We advise our children to ‘study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or career’ but this is risky advice. “That is old advice, and it’s bad advice. If you could see what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a Preview of What You Will Get:\r\n\r\n⁃ A Full Book Summary\r\n\r\n⁃ An Analysis\r\n\r\n⁃ Fun quizzes\r\n\r\n⁃ Quiz Answers\r\n\r\n⁃ Etc.\r\n\r\nGet a copy of this summary and learn about the book.",

Kiyosaki wendet sich daher erstmals direkt an Jugendliche mit seinem Appell, sich frühzeitig um die finanzielle Zukunft zu kümmern.<br/>\nGespickt mit persönlichen Geschichten und interaktiven Elementen vermittelt der Finanzexperte die Grundprinzipien seiner Geldphilosophie. Kurzweilig und zielgruppengerecht aufbereitet zeigt er, wie Jugendliche die Sprache des Geldes lernen und es ihnen gelingt, Geld für sich arbeiten zu lassen – anstatt selbst für Geld zu arbeiten.",

Which will earn you more, what the tradeoffs are, and how your personality should sway your choice \n Should you learn JavaScript, C#, Python, C++? How to decide which programming language you should master first \n Ever notice how every job ever posted requires \"3-5 years of experience,\" which you don't have? Simple solution for this frustrating chicken-and-egg problem that allows you to build legitimate job experience while you learn to code \n Is earning a computer science degree a necessity - or a total waste of time? How to get a college degree with maximum credibility and minimum debt \n Coding boot camps - some are great, some are complete scams. How to tell the difference so you don't find yourself cheated out of $10,000 \n Interviewer tells you, \"Dress code is casual around here - the development team wears flipflops.\" What should you wear? \n How do you deal with a boss who's a micromanager. Plus how helping your manager with his goals can make you the MVP of your team \n The technical skills that every professional developer must have - but no one teaches you (most developers are missing some critical pieces, they don't teach this stuff in college, you're expected to just \"know\" this)&#xa0;"

            "description": "Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.<br /><br />Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <i>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</i>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer - but only if you work at it.<br /><br /><i>Clean Code </i>is divided into three parts.<br /><br />\nThe first 13 chapters, fully contained in the audio, describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code.\nThe second part, chapters 14 to 16, consists of several case studies of increasing complexity and is included in a pdf that comes with your purchase. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code - of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. You’ll be reading code - lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it.\nThe third part, chapter 17, is provided both in the audio and the pdf. It is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.\n\n<br />Listeners will come away from <i>Clean Code </i>understanding:<br /><br />\nHow to tell the difference between good and bad code\nHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code\nHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes\nHow to format code for maximum readability\nHow to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic\nHow to unit test and practice test-driven development\n\n<br />This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.&#xa0;"

            "description": "<b>Newly adapted for audiobook listeners.</b><br /><br />Today, software engineers need to know not only how to program effectively but also how to develop proper engineering practices to make their codebase sustainable and healthy. This book emphasizes this difference between programming and software engineering.<br /><br />How can software engineers manage a living codebase that evolves and responds to changing requirements and demands over the length of its life? Based on their experience at Google, software engineers Titus Winters and Hyrum Wright, along with technical writer Tom Manshreck, present a candid and insightful look at how some of the world’s leading practitioners construct and maintain software. This book covers Google’s unique engineering culture, processes, and tools and how these aspects contribute to the effectiveness of an engineering organization.<br /><br />You’ll explore three fundamental principles that software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, writing, and maintaining code:\n\n\nHow time affects the sustainability of software and how to make your code resilient over time\nHow scale affects the viability of software practices within an engineering organization\nWhat trade-offs a typical engineer needs to make when evaluating design and development decisions"

Martin (“Uncle Bob”) reveals those rules and helps you apply them.<br /><br />Martin’s <i>Clean Architecture </i>doesn’t merely present options. Drawing on over a half-century of experience in software environments of every imaginable type, Martin tells you what choices to make and why they are critical to your success. As you’ve come to expect from Uncle Bob, this book is packed with direct, no-nonsense solutions for the real challenges you’ll face - the ones that will make or break your projects.<br />\n\nLearn what software architects need to achieve–and core disciplines and practices for achieving it\nMaster essential software design principles for addressing function, component separation, and data management\nSee how programming paradigms impose discipline by restricting what developers can do\nUnderstand what’s critically important and what’s merely a “detail”\nImplement optimal, high-level structures for web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded applications\nDefine appropriate boundaries and layers, and organize components and services\nSee why designs and architectures go wrong, and how to prevent (or fix) these failures\n\n<br /><i>Clean Architecture</i> is an essential book for every current or aspiring software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager - and for every programmer who must execute someone else’s designs."

            "description": "Listen to hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose. The third edition of <i>Managing Humans</i> contains a whole new season of episodes from the ongoing saga of Lopp's adventures in Silicon Valley, together with classic episodes remastered for high fidelity and freshness.&#xa0;<br /><br />Whether you're an aspiring manager, a current manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story in this book that will speak to you - and help you survive and prosper amid the general craziness of dysfunctional bright people caught up in the chase of riches and power. Scattered in repose among these manic misfits are managers, an even stranger breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been given power over the futures and the bank accounts of many others.&#xa0;&#xa0;<br /><br />Lopp's straight-from-the-hip style is unlike that of any other writer on management and leadership. He pulls no punches and tells stories he probably shouldn't. But they are magically instructive and yield Lopp’s trenchant insights on leadership that cut to the heart of the matter - whether it's dealing with your boss, handling a slacker, hiring top guns, or seeing a knotty project through to completion.&#xa0;<br /><br />Writing code is easy. Managing humans is not. You need a book to help you do it, and this is it.&#xa0;<br /><br />You'll learn to: lead engineers, handle conflict, hire well, motivate employees, manage your boss, discover how to say no, understand different engineering personalities, build effective teams, run a meeting well, and scale teams.&#xa0;<br /><br />Who This Book Is For&#xa0;<br /><br />Managers and would-be managers staring at the role of a manager wondering why they would ever leave the safe world of bits and bytes for the messy world of managing humans. The book covers handling conflict, managing wildly differing personality types, infusing innovation into insane product schedules, and figuring out how to build a lasting and useful engineering culture."
